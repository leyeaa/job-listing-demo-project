# Job Listing App

This is a job listing application that allows users to browse, search, and post job opportunities through a simple and intuitive interface. Users can explore available positions and view key details such as job title, company, location, and job type, making it easy to find relevant roles.

The application includes built-in job search functionality to quickly filter listings and a job posting feature that enables new opportunities to be added to the platform. This project demonstrates practical frontend development concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, and user interaction handling, and can be extended further with authentication, persistence, or API integration.
